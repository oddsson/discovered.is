# discovered.is
Displaying new releases from [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) in a new way. Discovered.is shows the release's genre as well, so that you can better choose what you want to listen to next. Simply click on what you like and start listening on Spotify.

## Project setup
This monorepo contains two projects, the UI project and the server project. The UI project contains all the UI logic while the server project is mainly responsible for authenticating with the Spotify API so that we can call the API.

## About
This project is witten with NextJS and deployed with Now. It's created to scratch a personal itch I had when I wanted to start listening to more new music. To run the project run `yarn dev` from the /UI folder to run the frontend and `yarn dev` from the /Server folder to run the API.
