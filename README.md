# discovered.is
Displaying new releases from [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) in a new way. Discovered.is shows the release's genre as well, so that you can better choose what you want to listen to next. Simply click what you like and start listening on Spotify.

## Project setup
This project is written in [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed with [Now](https://zeit.co/). Authenticating and fetching data from the Spotify API is handled in `/pages/api`. To run this project you can navigate to `/ui`, run `yarn && yarn dev` and you should be good to go ðŸ˜Š  

## About
It's created to scratch a personal itch I had when I wanted to start listening to more new music. It enables me to choose more precisely what to listen to next then the new releses functionality that Spotify currently offers.
